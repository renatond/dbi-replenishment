# Purchase Order Generation App

## Overview

This application automates the process of generating weekly purchase orders for Dirty Bird Industries. It takes various sales, inventory, and replenishment reports as input, applies business logic to calculate necessary order quantities, and generates a CSV file that can be directly imported into Cin7 Core.

The application can be run in two ways: through a simple web interface or as a command-line script.

## For End-Users

### How to Use the Web Application

The web interface is the easiest way to use the application.

1.  **Start the Server**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command from the project's main directory:
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
2.  **Access the Interface**: Open a web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
3.  **Upload Files**: Click the "Choose Files" button and select all of your weekly report files. The application will process them automatically.
4.  **Download PO File**: Once processing is complete, a download link will appear. Click it to download your `purchase_order.csv` file.

### How to Use the Manual Script

If you prefer to run the process from the command line, you can use the `manual_run.py` script. This is particularly useful for generating a PO for a specific warehouse location.

1.  **Run from Terminal**: Open a terminal and run the script with the desired location code (`nc` or `ca`):
    ```bash
    # For North Carolina
    python3 manual_run.py nc

    # For California
    python3 manual_run.py ca
    ```
2.  **Find Your File**: The script will generate a location-specific purchase order file in the project directory (e.g., `purchase_order_nc.csv`).

### Input File Requirements

For the application to work correctly, you must provide the following files. The filenames should follow the patterns listed below.

#### 1. Sales Reports from DEAR Systems
**Choose ONE of these options:**

**Option A: Combined Report (Recommended)**
- **Filename**: `Sales by Product Details Report.xlsx`
- **Instructions**: Export the complete report with all metrics (Sales, COGS, Profit, Quantity)
- **Format**: Single Excel file with data starting on row 6, columns arranged as: SKU | Sale | Quantity | COGS | Profit (repeating for each month)

**Option B: Separate Reports (Legacy Support)**  
- **Filenames**: 
    - `Sales by Product Details Report - Sales.xlsx`
    - `Sales by Product Details Report - COGS.xlsx` 
    - `Sales by Product Details Report - Profit.xlsx`
    - `Sales by Product Details Report - Quantity.xlsx`
- **Format**: Each file has 4 header rows, with SKU in first column and months as subsequent columns

#### 2. Replenishment Report (CSV)
- **Filename Pattern**: `replenishment-Combined [LOCATION] Warehouses-variants-*.csv` (e.g., `replenishment-Combined NC Warehouses-variants-2024.07.01-2025.08.31.24.csv`)
- **Required Columns**:
    - `SKU`: The product stock-keeping unit
    - `Lead time`: The supplier lead time in days
    - `Adjusted sales velocity/day`: The baseline daily sales velocity for the product
    - `Cost price`: The cost of the product

#### 3. Inventory List (CSV)
- **Filename Pattern**: `InventoryList_*.csv`
- **Required Columns**:
    - `ProductCode`: The SKU of the product.
    - `LastSuppliedBy`: The name of the default supplier for the product.

#### 4. Availability Report (CSV)
- **Filename Pattern**: `AvailabilityReport_*.csv`
- **Required Columns**:
    - `SKU`: The product stock-keeping unit.
    - `Location`: The warehouse location (e.g., `NC - Main`).
    - `Available`: The current available stock quantity.
    - `OnOrder`: The quantity of stock currently on order from suppliers.

## Key Features

### üè¢ Multi-Warehouse Support
The application supports generating purchase orders for both North Carolina (NC) and California (CA) warehouses independently. Users select the warehouse location via radio buttons in the web interface.

### üìä Enhanced Purchase Order Output
Generated purchase orders include comprehensive information:

| Column | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `RecordType*` | System | Always "Order" for Cin7 Core import |
| `SupplierName*` | InventoryList | Primary supplier for the product |
| `SupplierProductCode` | InventoryList | Supplier's internal product code |
| `Product*` | Replenishment | Your internal SKU |
| `ProductName` | InventoryList | Full product description |
| `Quantity*` | Calculated | Final order quantity after all adjustments |
| `Price/Amount*` | Replenishment | Cost price per unit |
| `Lead time` | Replenishment | Supplier lead time in days |
| `Adjusted Monthly Sales` | Calculated | Sales velocity per day √ó 30 |

### üö´ Supplier Exclusion Management
- **Web Interface**: Easily manage excluded suppliers via `/manage-suppliers` page
- **Real-Time Filtering**: Excluded suppliers are automatically removed from all POs
- **27 Pre-Configured Exclusions**: Includes problematic vendors, internal transfers, etc.
- **Case-Insensitive**: Matching works regardless of capitalization
- **Persistent Storage**: Exclusions saved in `excluded_suppliers.txt`

### üîß Intelligent File Processing
- **Combined File Support**: Uses single `Sales by Product Details Report.xlsx` (recommended)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports 4 separate Excel files 
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects file format and processes accordingly
- **Robust Stock Aggregation**: Combines stock from multiple bin locations per warehouse
- **On-Order Integration**: Factors in existing purchase orders to prevent over-ordering

### üìà Advanced Business Logic
- **Margin-Adjusted Sales Velocity**: Applies tiered velocity adjustments based on product price and profit margin
- **Dynamic Stock Calculation**: `Days of Stock = Lead Time + 3 days` safety buffer
- **Available Stock Consideration**: `PO Quantity = Target Stock - Available Stock - On Order Stock`

## For Developers

### Project Setup

1.  **Prerequisites**: Python 3.9+ and `venv`.
2.  **Create Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Project Structure

-   `app.py`: The Flask web server. Provides the user interface for file uploads and downloads.
-   `processing.py`: The core data processing logic. Contains all the functions for loading, cleaning, merging, and calculating the purchase order data.
-   `manual_run.py`: A command-line interface for running the processing logic directly.
-   `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the web interface.
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of all the Python dependencies.
-   `Dockerfile`: For containerizing the application.

### Core Logic (`processing.py`)

The data processing pipeline is orchestrated by the `run_po_generation` function and follows these steps:
1.  **Load Data**: Each source file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. During this step, data is cleaned (e.g., SKUs are normalized) and pre-processed (e.g., stock is aggregated by location).
2.  **Merge Data**: All DataFrames are merged into a single master DataFrame, using the `SKU` as the primary key.
3.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    -   `calculate_profit_margin()`: Calculates the profit margin from the sales and profit data.
    -   `adjust_sales_velocity()`: Applies the tiered margin adjustments to the baseline sales velocity.
    -   `calculate_po_quantity()`: Calculates the final PO quantity, factoring in lead time, available stock, and on-order stock.
4.  **Generate CSV**: The final DataFrame is formatted to match the Cin7 Core import template and saved as a CSV file.

### Running with Docker

The application can be built and run as a Docker container for easy deployment.

1.  **Build the Image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t po-generator .
    ```
2.  **Run the Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 po-generator
    ```
The application will then be available at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
